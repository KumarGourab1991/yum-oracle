yum-oracle Cookbook
============

The yum-oracle cookbook manages some of the yum repos to operate an Oracle
Linux system. 

Requirements
------------

* Chef 11 or higher
* yum cookbook version 3.0.0 or higher

Attributes
----------

The following attributes are set by default.

Recipes
-------
* default - Walks through node attributes and feeds a yum_resource
  parameters. The following is an example a resource generated by the
  recipe during compilation.
  
```ruby
  yum_repository 'ol6_latest' do
    baseurl 'http://public-yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL6/latest/$basearch/'
    description 'Oracle Linux $releasever Latest ($basearch)'
    enabled true
    gpgcheck true
    gpgkey 'file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle'
  end
```

Usage Example
-------------
To disable the Oracle 6 latest repository through a Role or Environment definition:

```
default_attributes(
  :yum => {
    :ol6_latest => {
      :enabled => {
        false
       }
     }
   }
 )
```

Special Note
------------

Oracle refers to Enterprise Linux 5 as "el5" and Enterprise Linux 6 as "ol6", so be careful.

Bugs
----

* ChefSpec unit tests don't work because Fauxhai doesn't have data for Oracle Linux (yet).
* Not all repositories that normally appear on an Oracle Linux system are managed yet by
  this cookbook, because most of them are turned off. Pull requests are accepted to do all
  the work to add them in.
